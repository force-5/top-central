Subordinate Use Cases: CARE Central Drools Non-Employee's Access Request

OPEN ISSUES

1. What are the rules for what workers a user can act as sponsor or delegate for?
Currently the system checks the security role of the user to see if they have rights to make an access request.  The security role may have further restrictions based on the application role of the user (business unit, ccGatekeeper, etc.).

1. How does the location manager perform user authentication?  In CARE Central we were using a JAR file provided by FPL that checked the corporate LDAP.  The business units may have their own LDAP.
